    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: STUPID RABBIT ASSHOLE SCREWS THE POOCH?</span>
    <br><span style="color: #0715cd">EB: no, it's about these criminals on a runaway plane, and they've got to be stopped by nick cage and john cusack together as a team.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: OH.</span>

    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: YOU'LL PROBABLY LAUGH IF I TELL YOU THE NAME OF ONE.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #0715cd">EB: well, i already laughed when you said the name of one of ours, so who cares?</span>
    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: OK FINE.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: ONE THAT IS AMAZING AND IS A CLASSIC IS...</span>
    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: WHEREIN NUMEROUS VIGILANTES CONFRONT PERIL; ONE OF THEM BETRAYS THE OTHERS; (BUT IT TURNS OUT TO BE PART OF THE PLAN ALL ALONG);</span>
    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: SEVERAL ATTRACTIVE FEMALE LEADS PROVOKE ROMANTIC TENSION; FOUR MAJOR CHARACTERS WEAR UNUSUAL HATS; ONE HOLDS PLOT-CRITICAL SECRET;</span>

    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: THEY TEND TO BE MORE LITERAL AND INFORMATIVE THAN YOUR TITLES.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #0715cd">EB: how do you even say them in casual conversation?</span>
    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: WELL WE DON'T OBVIOUSLY.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: IT'S LIKE SOMEONE SAYS, HEY GUYS WHY DON'T WE GO SEE A MOVIE, AND THEN EVERYONE JUST ENDS UP THERE.</span>

    <br><span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ok, i just think it's still cumbersome and completely illogical.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: YEAH THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU START RUNNING OUT OF MOVIE TITLES AFTER RACKING UP THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF FILM HISTORY.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: YOU KNOW I THINK YOUR CIVILIZATION JUST DIDN'T MATURE ENOUGH OR SOMETHING.</span>

    <br><span style="color: #0715cd">EB: well, i've got one of your godly players helping me now, so we can't be in such bad shape.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #0715cd">EB: GC gave me a map.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #0715cd">EB: and showed me a shortcut.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: WHAT THE HELL IS SHE DOING.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: THIS ISN'T WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT DOING AT ALL.</span>

    <br><span style="color: #0715cd">EB: uh, sorry i guess?</span>
    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: I TOLD HER TO STOP THESE SHENANIGANS...</span>
    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: BUT IT SEEMS LIKE WHATEVER SHE WAS DOING WITH YOU SHE ALREADY DID A WHILE AGO.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AT LEAST.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i don't know why you guys are doing this to yourselves.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #0715cd">EB: all this time jackassery, it's giving me a headache.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: OK IF YOU TALK TO HER AGAIN WHEN SHE TRIES HATCHING MORE PLANS GIVE HER A MESSAGE INTO THE PAST FOR ME.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ok.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: TELL HER TO POLISH MY HEAVING BONE BULGE AND SET A TABLE FOR FUCKING TWO ON IT.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: ITS FOR OUR CANDLE LIGHT HATE DATE.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i like how you guys have basically resorted to trolling each other, through us.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: FUCK YOU.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh, did you talk to jade yet?</span>
    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: JADE, WHAT WHY WOULD I WANT TO TALK TO HER?</span>
    <br><span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ummm, that's what you said you wanted to do last time you talked to me, i dunno.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: OH DAMMIT.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: ARE YOU SURE?</span>
    <br><span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yeah, you told me dude.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #0715cd">EB: want me to paste the conversation?</span>
    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: NO NO, GOD NO, I HATE IT WHEN WE START GOING DOWN THAT ROAD.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: OK THIS IS GOING TO REQUIRE FURTHER INVESTIGATION.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: I'VE GOT TO GO.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ok.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #0715cd">EB: but next time you talk to me, you might want to tell me to calm down first so i don't just block you.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #0715cd">EB: back then i won't really want to hear from you.</span>
    <br><span style="color: #626262">CG: OK, I'LL DO THAT.</span>
